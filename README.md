# Hotel-Review-text-data
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning techniques to automatically classify hotel review documents based on customer feedback. By leveraging a dataset of hotel review texts, the project aims to extract insights from customer reviews, enabling efficient sentiment analysis and category classification.

The system is designed to adapt to evolving hotel feedback trends and practices, making it scalable and future-proof for real-world applications in the hospitality industry.
Automatically classify hotel reviews into predefined categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
Develop a robust Deep Learning model for accurate text classification.
Enhance understanding of customer sentiment to improve hotel services.

Achieved a classification accuracy of RNN 82% on the test dataset.
Successfully categorized reviews into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments (or other relevant categories).

This project demonstrates the application of NLP and Deep Learning in the hospitality industry, showcasing how automated review classification can drive actionable insights and enhance customer satisfaction.
